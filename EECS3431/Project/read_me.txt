Hi!

I believe the code was perfected. But my understanding of the topic at hand proved
to be limited.

Only 4 tests produced the correct output:
1. testAmbient
2. testBackground
3. testBehind
4. testIntersection

In other words, the cases where ambience alone is sufficient.
The other cases require diffuse and specular, both of which were programmed as per the
pdf instructions, but I believe the way I'm calculating the normal to the surface is faulty.

Anyway this assignment was super fun regardless to the expected low grade. Will dig deeper into it 
after the final exam.

Thank you for your time!
